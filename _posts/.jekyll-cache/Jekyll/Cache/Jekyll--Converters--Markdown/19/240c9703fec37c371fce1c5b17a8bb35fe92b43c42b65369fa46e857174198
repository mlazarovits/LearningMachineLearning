I"è<p>We took a break from our regular paper discussions this week to host a tutorial on Tensorflow, a popular machine learning open-source software library. This is a low-level library that is used for higher level APIs, like Keras. We followed <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/low_level_intro">this</a> tutorial (just the Introduction section) to get a feel for the capabilities and applications of Tensorflow. The session was self-driven, with helpers floating around to answer any questions. I highly encourage those who are interested to explore more tutorials on our our <a href="../../../MLresources">Machine Learning Resources</a> page.</p>
