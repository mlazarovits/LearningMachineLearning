I"”<p>This week, we learned about how machine learning can help condensed matter physicists predict properties of certain materials. Professor Peelaers talked about a variety of topics, including compressed sensing, cluster expansion, and finding the ground state of a materialâ€™s structure. Slides from Professor Peelaers talk can be found <a href="../../../assets/pwrpts_fall19/machine_learning_Peelaers_120319.pdf">here</a>. Professor Peelaers also walked us through a tutorial on compressed sensing, focusing on the differences between the L1 and L2 norms.
