title: "10/23/19: Mining Imperfect Data with Professor Jerzy Gryzmala-Busse"
---
This week we enjoyed a lecture on mining imperfect data by Professor Gryzmala-Busse from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Slides from his talk can be found [here](../../../assets/pwrpts_fall19/mining_imperfect_data.pdf). Professor Gryzmala-Busse also points out that additional material on this subject can be found in his data mining class handouts: [EECS 690](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/handouts690.html), [EECS 837](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/handouts837.html), and [EECS 839](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/eecs839.html).
