title: "12/3/19: Machine Learning to Augment Material's Property Prediction with Professor Hartwin Peelaers"
---
This week, we learned about how machine learning can help condensed matter physicists predict properties of certain materials. Professor Peelaers talked about a variety of topics, including compressed sensing, cluster expansion, and finding the ground state of a material's structure. Slides from Professor Peelaers talk can be found [here](../../../assets/pwrpts_fall19/machilearning_Peelaers_120319.pdf). Professor Peelaers also walked us through a tutorial on compressed sensing, focusing on the differences between the L1 and L2 norms. This tutorial can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/peelaers/machine-learning-talk).
