title: "7/24/19 Tutorial: Tensorflow"
---

We took a break from our regular paper discussions this week to host a tutorial on Tensorflow, a popular machine learning open-source software library. This is a low-level library that is used for higher level APIs, like Keras. We followed [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/low_level_intro) tutorial (just the Introduction section) to get a feel for the capabilities and applications of Tensorflow. The session was self-driven, with helpers floating around to answer any questions. I highly encourage those who are interested to explore more tutorials on our our [Machine Learning Resources](../../../MLresources) page.
