<p>This week we enjoyed a lecture on mining imperfect data by Professor Gryzmala-Busse from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Slides from his talk can be found <a href="../../../assets/pwrpts_fall19/mining_imperfect_data.pdf">here</a>. Professor Gryzmala-Busse also points out that additional material on this subject can be found in his data mining class handouts: <a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/handouts690.html">EECS 690</a>, <a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/handouts837.html">EECS 837</a>, and <a href="https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzygb/eecs839.html">EECS 839</a>.</p>
