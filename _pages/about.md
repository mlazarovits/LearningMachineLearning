We are a student-led group of machine learners! Students, professors, post-docs and more gather weekly to discuss machine learning in various contexts. Although mostly physics focused, we love to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. Our weekly meetings involve research discussions, journal clubs, tutorials and more! If you would like to sign up for our mailing list please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeySIEWeEl_0ew6r_0G6py5qhpB1Rf_ZNq6tkmYXE6CvTwBLg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
