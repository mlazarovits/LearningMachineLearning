We are a student-led group of machine learners! Students, professors, post-docs and more gather weekly to discuss machine learning in various contexts. Although mostly physics focused, we love to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. Our weekly meetings involve research discussions, journal clubs, tutorials and more! If you would like to sign up for our mailing list please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeySIEWeEl_0ew6r_0G6py5qhpB1Rf_ZNq6tkmYXE6CvTwBLg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

This group was founded in Spring 2019 by KU graduate student Margaret Lazarovits, along with guidance from her advisor, Professor Chris Rogan. They are a part of the particle physics group at the Physics department of the University of Kansas. Professor Rogan's research spans a wide variety of projects, including hardware, analysis and phenomenology. 

Currently, Margaret and Professor Rogan are working on research and design (R&D) for the new MIP Timing Detector, an upgrade to the CMS detector as part of the High Luminosity LHC upgrade. They study the properities and behavior of low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) for precision timing purposes using machine learning methods like artificial and convolutional neural networks. 

Along with the particle physics group at KU, Margaret and Professor Rogan are also working on a search for supersymmetry in the electroweak sector using Professor Rogan's recursive jigsaw reconstruction method.

Margaret and Professor Rogan are always interested in machine learning collaborations with other departments and insitutions! Feel free to email [Margaret](mrlazarovits@gmail.com) or [Professor Rogan](crogan@ku.edu) for more information.
